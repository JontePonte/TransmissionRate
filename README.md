# TransmissionRate
A model of transmission of an infection in a population
The model is based on the math from an episode of Numberphile on youtube

## Roadmap

### Version 1.2
- [ ] Create sliders/nobs for transmission and recovery rate
- [ ] Change recovery rate based on number of infected and healthy people in population
- [ ] Change D-rate based on the same variables

### Version 1.1
- [x] Add a "D" category
- [ ] Set colors in plot and make it bigger

### Version 1.0
- [x] Make the basic simulation operational
